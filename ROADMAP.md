# Rewrite Roadmap

This is the roadmap for the current rewrite.

## Core

- [ ] use classes for most exports
- [ ] clean code and make it more readable
- [ ] switch to [`i18next`][i18next] package instead of wonky custom implementation
- [ ] extend discord.js's classes to avoid importing from index.js
- [ ] work on using database space more, currently the user can't set _any_ configuration of their guild
- [ ] tags
- [ ] use pronouns more widely

## Other

- [ ] fix TS Errors generated by moving to new I18n package
- [ ] prune command
- [ ] buttons in sh command
