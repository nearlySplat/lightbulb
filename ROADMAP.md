# Project Roadmap

<!-- HOW TO USE: --
  --
  -- Add new items with the template: `[ ] item (date)`
  -- Check items off by editing `[ ]` to `[x]` and appending `, resolved on date` to the parentheses
  --
  -->

This is the roadmap for the current rewrite.

## Core

[ ] use classes for most exports
[ ] clean code and make it more readable
[ ] switch to [`i18next`][i18next] package instead of wonky custom implementation

## Other

[ ] Fix TS Errors generated by moving to new I18n package (12/7/21)
