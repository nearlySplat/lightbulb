# Rewrite Roadmap

This is the roadmap for the current rewrite.

## Core

- [ ] use classes for most exports
- [ ] clean code and make it more readable
- [x] switch to [`i18next`][i18next] package instead of wonky custom implementation
- [ ] extend discord.js's classes to avoid importing from index.js
- [ ] tags
- [ ] use pronouns more widely
- [ ] Guild settings (currently prefixes are supported but you can't set it)
- [ ] remove Command#description, replace with ``t(`${command}.description`)``, also make it optional

## Other

- [ ] fix TS Errors generated by moving to new I18n package
- [ ] prune command
- [ ] buttons in sh command
- [ ] split textedit command into smaller ones
