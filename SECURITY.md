# Security Policy

## Supported Versions/Branches

As of right now, development is currently focused on the 
[`rewrite`](https://github.com/nearlySplat/lightbulb/tree/rewrite) branch.
However, security vulnerabilities may still be reported for other major 
branches (i.e. `development`). Merged branches are not supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a vulnerability by sending an email to 
[splatterxl@outlook.ie](mailto:splatterxl@outlook.ie). Whatever you
do, please **don't report security vulnerabilities in the Issues tab or
attempt to fix them yourself in the Pull Requests**.

You *should* receive a response in less than 3 working days, and a fix
should be implemented in less than 7 working days. 

You will be credited and depending on the severity of the vulnerability,
you may be rewarded.
