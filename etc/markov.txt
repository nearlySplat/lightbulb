You meant IDE

mhm
I feel like making a markov for frosty
wait wut
how is bulb a start of sentence
aaaaaaaa
I am disappointed not only in you, but in people who manually write any kind of copy-pasta, either intentionally or unintentionally. This is a huge waste of space on Discord's servers, which can be easily replaced with rapid, short, meaningless messages which, taken out of context, cannot be understood or read correctly. In fact, copy-pastas amount for almost a kagjillion per cent of all infractions relating to spam in Discord. It is completely irresponsible for anyone to write copy-pastas manually, since it uses more of your brain than the 10 per cent allotted to normal function. Why use it for copy-pastas?! Why not use your extra capacity for more meaningful things such as bananas without the ending na? Why not make flying cars? Indeed, many copy-pastas are available on the r/copypasta subreddit, and why not use the data that is on the Internet, which is meant for use, to our advantage?!

good
97% of normal Discord users would post the stupid copy-pasta about Justin Beiber. If you are one of the 3% sane people, ban everyone who posts that copy-pasta.

not only that, but many MANY MAAAANNNNYYY breaking changes which mean that nobody should ever change a working bot using the NPM v12.5.x package into a bot using master.
uWu
nice
> manually write any kind of sentence
uh
thanks autojag
but bots still have feelings
I'm still pretty spooked about an AI that can literally write code
When AI learns to substitute self-written code over its own, we will all perish
I mean, even if the Three Laws of (self-aware) Robotics are included, it might eventually learn to override them
it's still a backup plan for when robots try to wipe out their creators
I knew I'd get rekt
machine *learning*
eh
machine learning combined with AI will be pretty cool ig
ayy 32 days of uptime for my bot

add a way to manually mute/unmute, then add timed mutes, using timeouts or a db or whatever
and add permanent mutes

I'm possibly going to make my markov not use an average sentence length and instead use a while loop that breaks once no word can be supplied
but that could make an infinite loop if I send enough spam messages
nope
the emojis are gone
Any idea when your brother windows 9 will be released then

I feel an urge to just fix all my spelling errors in my markov file
steadily increasing now that I fixed the bug that caused it to be ignoring every message except bot commands
doesn't the ietf rfc things say "this is not a specification"
just me being a dumbass and misinterpreting the context again
bru
that's saying black people are monkeys
which is very uncool
and uncool things like that should not be posted anywhere

pretty easy

ALTER TABLE "starboardmessage" ADD "id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ADD "messageid" INTEGER ADD "starboardchannelid" INTEGER ADD "originalchannelid" INTEGER;
```
me writing an SQL query be like
also
FACTS
that's also racist
starboard
to edit the message
to get the right message + channel id
And you probably use .find
which is extremely bad practice, because some messages could be uncached therefore duplicated by your obviously flawed logic
you... fetch them before
so for a message to be updated in the starboard channel, you have to fetch it manually
because
it's
inefficient
Applying blanket stereotypes to particular OS users
maybe a targeted fetch instead of `.fetch({})` then `.find`

I love how Postgres just echos the query

DROP TABLE

TRUNCATE TABLE

Splatterxl's guide to making a discord bot in typescript 
Step one: use this highly complicated bash script: ```sh

t() {
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/nearlysplat/lightbulb

that's unhealthy for your bot
