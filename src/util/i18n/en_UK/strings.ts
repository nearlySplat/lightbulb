What you're refering to as {{text}}, is in fact, GNU/{{text}}, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus {{text}}. {{text}} is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called {{text}}, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a {{text}}, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. {{text}} is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. {{text}} is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with {{text}} added, or GNU/{{text}}. All the so-called {{text}} distributions are really distributions of GNU/{{text}}!

**Buttons**
You may notice we are using buttons for this command. Yes, we are, but because of the 5√ó5 (${
  5 * 5
}) limit on the amount of buttons on each message, you'll be using text to control your pieces.

Since this looks absolutely horrible on mobile, we have taken care to have the bot delete valid commands (related to the current game, of course) when it can. And, if it can't, it'll react with ‚úÖ or ‚ùå depending on whether the command was valid.

**How to play**
We are using a chess framework called **[chess.js](https://npmjs.com/package/chess.js)** to manage your games, so all the [rules of chess](https://rcc.fide.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FIDE_Laws-Of_Chess_2018-1.pdf) \\*should\\* be reflected.

**Commands**
To use any of the commands listed below, just type them in chat! No prefix, no anything.

*Mods, if you're reading this, only players in a current game are responded to.*

- \`show me the legal moves\` ‚Äî ... shows you the legal moves
- \`what colour am I\` (with the capital \`I\`) ‚Äî self explanatory
- \`resign\` ‚Äî forfeits your move and awards the other player with a win
- and finally, any valid move (see the first command) ‚Äî resolves the pieces to move, moves those pieces, captures pieces if necessary and forwards the move to the next person. *Note: reacts with ‚ùå if the move is illegal*`;
