          From moderation to utility to scratching your butt, Lightbulb is (not)
          the bot for you. With absolutely no worthwhile features and a lazy,
          procrastinating author, Lightbulb is bound to be the worst bot you
          could ever invite to your server.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you manage to be dumb enough to invite it, you'll have <%=
          commands.size %> glorious commands at your disposal, none of which
          work as intended.

          With absolutely nothing in common with most other bots, Lightbulb is
          the absolute worst choice you can make from the whole variety of bots
          on Discord. If you wanna look at a list of actually good bots, take a
          look at <a href="//discord.bots.gg">this bot list.</a>
